THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE SUBJECT TO MODIFICATION AS OUTLINED HEREIN.</strong></p><p>Script Derm and its affiliated companies (referred to collectively as “Script Derm,” “we,” or “us”) are the proprietors of the websites at www.scriptderm.com and may have owned, currently own, or in the future own and/or operate a Script Derm mobile application (together known as the “Platform”). Your access to and use of the Platform, any part of it, or anything associated with it, including its content (“Content”), any products or services offered through the Platform or by Script Derm, and any affiliated website, software, or application managed or operated by Script Derm (collectively, including the Platform and the Content, referred to as the “Service”) are subject to these Terms and Conditions (“Terms and Conditions” or “Agreement”).</p><p>It is important to read this Agreement thoroughly as it contains crucial terms relevant to the Service. In this Agreement, “you” and “yours” refer to the individual utilizing the Service. In instances where the Service is used by or on behalf of a minor, “you” and “yours” include (i) the parent or legal guardian consenting to the minor&#x27;s use of the Service or using the Service on the minor&#x27;s behalf, and (ii) the minor for whom consent is given or on whose behalf the Service is used.

Should you not fully accept and commit to this Agreement, you are strictly forbidden from engaging with, accessing, registering for, or using the Service, except as needed to review this Agreement. Please note that the Service is continuously evolving, and we reserve the exclusive right to modify or withdraw any portion of this Agreement or the Service at our discretion without prior notice to you. Changes to this Agreement take effect immediately once they are published on the Platform. Furthermore, unless specified otherwise, any new Content added to the Service will be governed by this Agreement from the moment it is made available on the Platform. If you find any part of this Agreement or any included terms or conditions unacceptable, your only recourse is to cease using the Service. By continuing to use the Service after amendments have been made to this Agreement, you are signifying your acceptance of the revised Agreement.</p><p><strong>Your Relationship with Us</strong></p><p>Individuals who register as users of the Service (“Users”) are given access to various products and services offered either by Script Derm or by third-party medical providers, pharmacies, or other vendors through our Service. Our Service enables you to use prescription fulfillment services from the following pharmacies: Foothills pharmacy, along with other compounding pharmacies (collectively, “Pharmacies”). and occasionally, may provide laboratory services from entities such as Rutgers Clinical Genomics Laboratory at RUCDR Infinite Biologics – Rutgers University (“Labs”). By agreeing to this Agreement, you acknowledge and consent to your prescription(s) being processed and transferred among the Pharmacies, and authorize the Service to manage these transactions on your behalf. Additionally, we facilitate access to several medical groups that deliver healthcare services via the Platform (“Medical Groups”), including Script Medical Group, LLC (“Providers”). Accepting this Agreement means you recognize that services received from the Labs, Pharmacies, Medical Groups, or Providers via the Platform are governed by this Agreement, and that these entities are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement.</p><p>We do not exercise control over or interfere with the medical care practices of the Medical Groups or any Providers. Each is independently responsible for the medical care and/or treatment they administer to you. By accepting this Agreement, you understand and agree that Script Derm is not a healthcare provider and using the Service does not establish a doctor-patient or healthcare provider-patient relationship with Script Derm. However, by using the Service, you may form such a relationship with the Medical Group and/or one or more Providers. Moreover, we do not interfere with the professional services provided by the Labs and Pharmacies, each being wholly accountable for their professional services offered through the Service.</p><p>By agreeing to this Agreement, you also acknowledge that the Medical Group and/or Providers may communicate with you through the Service about your diagnosis and/or treatment. You comprehend and agree that Script Derm is not accountable for the security or privacy of any communication services you utilize to receive messages, reports, and emails from the Service outside of the Platform. It is your responsibility to check and respond to these communications. Neither Script Derm, the Medical Group, nor any Provider will bear responsibility for any consequences arising from your neglect to read or respond to these communications or your non-compliance with treatment suggestions or instructions from the Medical Group or your Provider(s).</p><p>While you don&#x27;t establish a doctor-patient or healthcare provider-patient relationship with Script Derm, by using the Service, you do establish a direct customer relationship with Script Derm for the utilization of the Service, including purchasing non-prescription products or non-medical services directly from Script Derm via the Service. In this relationship, you might provide us, or authorize the provision on your behalf, personal information, including health information, which we will use in accordance with our Privacy Policy. Please see the “Privacy Policy” and “Protected Information” sections for further details.</p><p><strong>Notice of Financial Responsibility for Services</strong></p><p>Script Derm and the Medical Groups are not participants in, nor do they have enrollment with, any federal or state healthcare programs, such as Medicare or Medicaid, for the delivery of any healthcare or mental health services or supplies. Consequently, neither you, Script Derm, nor the Medical Groups can receive payments from such programs for the services or products provided to you by Script Derm or the Medical Groups. Additionally, even if any of the Labs, Pharmacies, or Providers are enrolled in federal or state healthcare programs, the manner in which the services and products are offered or accessed via the Service generally excludes these services and products from being eligible for coverage under these programs. By opting to use the Service, you are deliberately choosing to purchase products and services with your own funds, outside the scope of any federal or state healthcare program. Therefore, you bear the full cost of any service or product provided to you.</p><p>By choosing to use the Service, you acknowledge and agree that (1) you are making a conscious decision to acquire products and services on a cash basis, independent of any federal or state healthcare program, and you have the sole financial responsibility for all services or products provided to you via the Service; and (2) neither you, Script Derm, the Labs, the Pharmacies, the Medical Groups, nor the Providers will seek reimbursement from any federal or state healthcare program for the costs incurred for the services and products supplied to you through the Service.</p><p><strong>Subscription-Based Products and Services</strong></p><p>Some products and services offered through the Service are available on a subscription model, which involves automatic renewal and recurring charges. For these subscription products and services, your payment method will be automatically billed at regular intervals as specified during the checkout process for each product or service. This billing will continue until you cancel your subscription. Also, your future shipments may be charged and dispatched up to two (2) days in advance, either to adjust for holidays or for other operational reasons, maintaining continuous treatment. </p><p>You can cancel a subscription anytime by sending a cancellation request to support@scriptderm.com, or through your online account. The cancellation becomes effective at the end of the current billing cycle. Remember, your subscription will automatically renew for another period unless you cancel at least two (2) days before your next renewal date. We do not typically issue refunds for partially used subscription periods but may consider them on a case-by-case basis at our sole discretion. Additionally, we might offer an option to pause your subscription for a set period. If not canceled before the pause period ends, charges to your payment method will recommence. Please note, we may modify our subscription plans and pricing, but we will give you advance notice of any such changes.</p><p>For ease of use, the Service displays a single “total” subscription price. However, if your subscription includes a product that requires a consultation with a Provider, or a prescription filled through one of the Pharmacies, then the total price encompasses fees for using the Service, as well as charges by the Pharmacy for the prescription drug and by the Medical Group for the Provider&#x27;s services. These amounts are collected and then forwarded to the Pharmacies and Medical Groups, respectively.</p><p><strong>Prescription Product Availability</strong></p><p>Several products offered on the Platform necessitate a valid prescription from a licensed healthcare provider. Access to these prescription products is contingent upon completing a consultation with one of the Providers, who must then determine that the product is suitable for your needs and subsequently issue a prescription.</p><p>Should a Provider assess that a prescription product is appropriate for you and provide a prescription, you will be informed about your options for filling it. Some prescriptions may be filled through one of the Pharmacies via the Platform, or you have the option to fill the prescription at a pharmacy of your choosing, as indicated during your Service use or by sending a request to support@scriptderm.com. It’s important to note that prescriptions can be transferred between the Pharmacies without prior notification. Be aware that not all prescriptions filled by the Pharmacies come in child-resistant packaging, and your prescription may be delivered in a non-child-resistant container.</p><p>There are certain medications, including those for many standard dermatologic conditions, that are not available through the Pharmacies and must be filled at a local pharmacy of your choice, as directed during your Service interaction. In such an instance, you are responsible for collecting the prescription product and directly paying the pharmacy for its cost.</p><p>If you undergo a consultation with a Provider and have a prescription filled by one of the Pharmacies, the prescription product will be shipped to you by the relevant Pharmacy. The costs for the prescription are included in the total price charged by the Service, as detailed in the “Subscription Products” section above. However, if you choose to have your prescription filled at a pharmacy other than the Pharmacies, the Service will forward the prescription to your selected pharmacy. In this case, you are responsible for collecting the prescription product and directly paying the pharmacy for its cost.</p><p>Prescription products obtained through the Platform are categorized as “Third-Party Goods and Services,” as outlined in the Third-Party Goods and Services section of this Agreement.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>Laboratory Products and Services</strong></p><p>Certain laboratory products services available through the Platform, including at-home testing kits and services, require a valid prescription or order by a licensed healthcare provider. You will not be able to obtain such laboratory services unless you have completed a consultation with one of the Providers, the Provider has determined the laboratory product and/or service is appropriate for you and the Provider has prescribed or ordered the laboratory product and/or service.</p><p>Currently, laboratory products and services offered through the Platform can only be ordered and fulfilled through the Labs and are not available through local laboratories. If you receive laboratory products and/or services from a Lab through the Platform, the applicable testing materials are shipped to you by the applicable Lab, and the costs associated with the laboratory products and services are included in the total charged to you by the Service.</p><p>Laboratory products and services available through the Platform are “Third-Party Goods and Services” as described in the Third-Party Goods and Services section of this Agreement.</p><p><strong>Limited Use and Availability</strong></p><p>Our Service is currently only available to individuals who are located in states in which we offer the Service, are at least eighteen (18) years of age or older, or at least the age of majority in their jurisdiction of residence, if higher than eighteen (18), and who have accepted this Agreement; provided, however, that individuals who are located in the states in which we offer the Service and are between the ages of 13 and 18 may use the Service for the sole purpose of obtaining a medical consultation for the treatment of acne using topical skincare products (to the extent available through the Service) so long as      a parent or legal guardian provides consent to such use in accordance with the requirements set forth in this Agreement and the Service. By visiting, accessing, registering with or using the Service, you are (a) representing and warranting to us that you are either (1) at least eighteen (18) years of age or older or at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence, if higher than eighteen (18), or (2) at least thirteen (13) years of age, have obtained consent from your parent or legal guardian to use the Service, and will use the Service for the sole purpose of obtaining a medical consultation for the treatment of acne; (b) if you are a parent or legal guardian providing consent for an individual minor who is under the age of eighteen (18) (or such higher age of majority under applicable state law), representing and warranting to us that you are the parent or legal guardian for such minor and have all legal power and authority to provide consent for the use of the Service by such minor; (c) representing and warranting to us that when you use the Service to consult with a Provider, you are located in the same state as the shipping address you provide in your account at the time that you conduct such consultation; (d) agreeing to comply with all applicable laws in visiting, accessing, registering with our using the service; and (e) agreeing that you will only use the Service for lawful purposes. Our Service is subject to state regulations and may change from time to time due to changes in applicable regulatory requirements.</p><p>Certain products available through the Service are subject to additional age restrictions, and not all products or services are available to all ages.</p><p>In some cases, the Service may not be the most appropriate way for you to provide information to communicate with or seek medical and/or mental health care and treatment from a healthcare provider or mental health professional. For example, certain medical conditions may require an in-person procedure or a healthcare provider other than your Provider, or your Provider may determine that your diagnosis and/or treatment requires an in-person office visit or are otherwise not appropriately addressed through use of the Service. In such a case, you may receive notification that you will be unable to use the Service for the issue you submitted with additional information regarding next steps.</p><p><strong>Consent to Use of Telehealth Services</strong></p><p>Telehealth involves the delivery of health and mental health care services using electronic communications, information technology or other means between a healthcare provider or mental health professional and a patient who are not in the same physical location. While the provision of health and mental health care services using telehealth may offer certain potential benefits, there are also potential risks associated with the use of telehealth. The telehealth services are not a substitute for in-person care in all cases. To use the Service, you will be required to review and agree to an informed consent regarding the use of telehealth (the “Patient Consent”) that will be provided to you via the Service. You agree that Script Derm is a third-party beneficiary of the Patient Consent and has the right to enforce it against you.</p><p><strong>Duty to Provide Information, Access, and Connectivity</strong></p><p>You are responsible for providing and maintaining, at your own risk, option and expense, appropriate software and hardware capabilities (consistent with any technical, quality or other requirements described in the Service) to enable use of the Service, including but not limited to, a computer or mobile device with a video camera and Internet access. You are solely responsible for any fees, including Internet connection or mobile fees, that you incur when accessing the Service. You also have a duty to provide truthful, accurate and complete information in any forms or other communications you submit to or through the Service. We reserve the right to change the access configuration, including any software, hardware or other requirements of the Service at any time without prior notice.</p><p><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></p><p>Script Derm understands the importance of confidentiality and privacy regarding your personal information. Please see our privacy policy for a description of how we may collect, use and disclose your personal information.</p><p><strong>Protected Health Information</strong></p><p>When you set up an account with Script Derm, you are creating a direct customer relationship with Script Derm that enables you to access and/or utilize the various functions of the Service as a user. As part of that relationship, you provide information to Script Derm, including but not limited to your name, email address, shipping address and phone number, that we may collect, use and disclose in accordance with our Privacy Policy, and that we do not consider to be “health” or “medical” information.</p><p>However, in using certain components of the Service, you may also provide certain medical information that may be protected under applicable laws. Script Derm LLC is not a “covered entity” under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Public Law 104-191, and its related regulations and amendments from time to time (collectively, “HIPAA”). One or more of the Labs, Pharmacies or Medical Groups may or may not be a “covered entity” or “business associate” under HIPAA, and Script Derm may in some cases be a “business associate” of a Lab, Pharmacy or Medical Group. It is important to remember that, while state-specific privacy laws may apply, HIPAA does not necessarily apply to an entity or person simply because there is health information involved, and HIPAA may not apply to your transactions or communications with Script Derm, the Medical Groups, the Providers, the Labs, or the Pharmacies. To the extent Script Derm is deemed a “business associate” however, and solely in its role as a business associate, Script Derm, may be subject to certain provisions of HIPAA with respect to “protected health information,” as defined under HIPAA, that you provide to the Labs, Pharmacies, or Medical Groups (“PHI”). In addition, any medical or health information that you provide that is subject to specific protections under applicable state laws (collectively, with PHI, “Protected Information”), will be used and disclosed only in accordance with such applicable laws. However, any information that does not constitute Protected Information under applicable laws may be used or disclosed in any manner permitted under our Privacy Policy. Protected Information does not include information that has been de-identified in accordance with HIPAA.</p><p>The Medical Groups and Providers have adopted a Notice of Privacy Services that describes how they use and disclose Protected Information. By accessing or using any part of the Service, you are acknowledging receipt of the Notice of Privacy Practices from your Medical Group and Provider(s).</p><p>By using the Service, you are agreeing that even if HIPAA does apply to Script Derm, the Medical Groups, the Providers, the Labs, or the Pharmacies, any information that you submit to Script Derm that is not intended and used solely for the provision of diagnosis and treatment by the Medical Group and Providers or prescription fulfillment by the Pharmacies or laboratory services by the Labs, is not considered Protected Information, and will only be subject to our Privacy Policy and any applicable state laws that govern the privacy and security of such information.</p><p><strong>Registration; User Accounts, Passwords, and Security</strong></p><p>You are obligated to register and set up an account in the Platform in order to access the Service, and the Service is available only to Users who have registered and have been granted accounts with usernames and passwords. For purposes of clarity, information you provide to Script Derm in order to register and set up an account on the Platform, including name, username, email address, shipping address and phone number, are not considered Protected Information for purposes of the Protected Health Information section above. You agree to accurately maintain and update any information about yourself that you have provided to Script Derm, a Medical Group or its Providers, the Labs or the Pharmacies. If you do not keep such information current, or fail to submit truthful, accurate and complete information, or we have reasonable grounds to suspect as much, we have the right to suspend or terminate your account and your use of the Service. You also agree to immediately notify Script Derm of any unauthorized use of your username, password or any other breach of security that you become aware of involving or relating to the Service by emailing Script Derm at support@scriptderm.com. In addition, you agree to keep confidential your username and password and to exit from your User account at the end of each session. Script Derm explicitly disclaims liability for any and all losses and damages arising from your failure to comply with this section.

You are prohibited from violating, or attempting to violate, the security of the Service. Any such violations may result in criminal and/or civil penalties against you.

In the event of an error, we reserve the right to correct the error and revise your order accordingly (which includes charging the correct price) or to cancel the order and refund any amount charged. Prices for products are subject to change at any time. You are responsible for any applicable sales, use, duty, customs or other governmental taxes, levies or fees (“Taxes”) due with respect to your purchase of products or services through our Service. We will collect applicable Taxes if we determine we have a duty to collect Taxes. We will present an estimate of Taxes we collect at checkout, except where we have clearly stated in writing that a price includes Taxes. The actual Taxes charged may be adjusted from the amount shown at checkout. Several factors may cause this, such as variances between processor programs and changes in tax rates. We are not required to, and do not, collect Taxes in all states. You may have a duty to directly report and pay Taxes if we do not collect such Taxes.</p><p>Only valid payment methods acceptable to us may be used to complete a purchase via the Service. You represent and warrant that you are authorized to use your designated payment method. You authorize us to charge your designated payment method for the total amount of your order (including any applicable taxes and shipping and handling charges). If your designated payment method is declined, we will attempt to process your charge until the transaction is approved. We and our third-party payment service providers may request, and may receive, updated payment card information from your payment card issuer, such as updated card numbers and expiration date information when your credit card has expired. If such updated information is provided to us and our third-party payment service providers, you agree we may update your account information accordingly, and will use such updated information to process payments for your future purchases and applicable subscription charges (including any applicable taxes, shipping and handling charges). Your payment card issuer may give you the right to opt out of providing vendors and third-party payment service providers with your updated card information. If you wish to opt out of your payment card’s updating service, you should contact your card issuer. We are not responsible for any fees or charges that your bank or payment card issuer may apply. If your bank or card issuer reverses a charge to your payment card, we may bill your account directly and seek payment by another method including a mailed statement.</p><p>If any of the products in your order are unavailable, we will only charge the prices, Taxes and other applicable charges associated with the products that are included in the shipment. In connection with any purchase you make through the Service, you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to the transaction, including, without limitation, your payment card number and expiration date, your billing address, your shipping address, your phone number and/or your email address. By submitting such information, you grant Script Derm without charge the irrevocable, unencumbered, universe-wide and perpetual right to provide such information (and any updated information we receive) to third parties (e.g., payment processing companies, buyers on the Service, sellers on the Service) for the purpose of facilitating the transaction.</p><p>All credit card, debit card and other monetary transactions on or through the Service occur through an online payment processing application(s) accessible through the Service. This online payment processing application(s) is provided by Script Derm’ third-party online payment processing vendor, Stripe (“Stripe”). Additional information about Stripe, its privacy policy and its information security measures (collectively, the “Stripe Policies”) should be available on the Stripe website located at https://stripe.com/us/privacy or by contacting Stripe directly. Reference is made to the Stripe Policies for informational purposes only and are in no way incorporated into or made a part of this Agreement. Script Derm’ relationship with Stripe, if any, is merely contractual in nature, as Stripe is nothing more than a third-party vendor to Script Derm and is in no way subject to Script Derm direction or control; thus, their relationship is not, and should not be construed as, one of fiduciaries, franchisors-franchisees, agents-principals, employers-employees, partners, joint venturers or the like.</p><p>You agree to pay any shipping and handling charges, if any, shown at the time you make a purchase. We reserve the right to increase, decrease, add, or eliminate shipping and handling charges from time to time, but we will provide notice of the changes applicable to you before you make your purchase.

THE ARBITRATION WILL BE GOVERNED BY THE AAA’S CONSUMER ARBITRATION RULES AND, IF THE ARBITRATOR DEEMS THEM APPLICABLE, THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER RELATED DISPUTES (COLLECTIVELY, “RULES AND PROCEDURES”). YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE VOLUNTARILY AND KNOWINGLY FORFEITING YOUR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND TO OTHERWISE PROCEED IN A LAWSUIT IN STATE OR FEDERAL COURT, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, “DISPUTE” WILL ALSO INCLUDE DISPUTES THAT AROSE OR INVOLVE FACTS OCCURING BEFORE THE EXISTENCE OF THIS OR ANY PRIOR VERSIONS OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AS WELL AS CLAIMS THAT MAY ARISE AFTER THE TERMINATION OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.</strong></p><p>In the event a Dispute arises between us, we are committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution. You and we agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost and mutually beneficial outcome. You and we therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”). If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference.</p><p>The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (“Notice”), which shall occur within forty-five (45) days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. Notice to us that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to support@scriptderm.com or regular mail to our offices located at 8 The Green #17369, Dover, DE 19901. The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute. We will provide notice to your address on file. The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree.</p><p>If you and we are unable to resolve a Dispute within thirty (30) days after the applicable Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, either party may commence arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual.</p><p>Payment of arbitration costs will be governed by the AAA’s fee schedule. Each party agrees to pay its own attorneys’ fees and expenses unless there is a governing statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid attorneys’ fees and expenses.</p><p>The arbitration shall be conducted in Dover, DE, except that, in the event Dover, Delaware is not within one hundred (100) miles of your residence, the arbitration may be conducted within one hundred (100) miles of your residence, unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding on all parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. These Terms and Conditions evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings.</p><p>For more information on AAA, its Rules and Procedures, and how to file an arbitration claim, you may call AAA at 800-778-7879 or visit the AAA website at https://www.adr.org.</p><p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent the Dispute arises from: (a) a violation of either party’s intellectual property rights in any manner; and/or (b) any claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, unauthorized use or a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act; then you and the applicable Script Derm Party agree that a party may seek injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in a state or federal court in Dover, Delware, and both parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts in connection with such proceedings. In addition to the foregoing, either you or we may assert an individual action in small claims court for Disputes that are within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration as long as such action remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis.</p><p><strong>YOU AND WE HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. </strong>You and we are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified otherwise herein. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</p><p><strong>YOU AND WE AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED HEREIN, ALL DISPUTES SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. NO PARTY MAY BRING ANY CLAIM SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, OR AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS PROCEEDING. THE CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE JOINED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE CONSOLIDATED OR JOINED WITH ANY OTHER ARBITRATION EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED HEREIN. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S).</strong> If a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular claim or request for relief, then such claim or request for relief (and only that claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Dover, Delaware, subject to the parties’ respective rights to appeal the decision. All other claims or requests for relief shall be arbitrated. The parties agree that any claims or requests for relief that are severed from an arbitration may not proceed in litigation and shall be stayed until all claims between the parties remaining in arbitration are finally resolved. The parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Dover, Delaware for purposes of resolving any claims or requests for relief severed from arbitration pursuant to this paragraph. This subsection does not prevent you or us from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.</p><p>To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and we agree that in the event that there are one hundred (100) or more individual arbitrations of a substantially similar nature filed against us by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of one hundred (100) arbitrations per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than one hundred (100) arbitrations left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining arbitrations); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (“Batch Arbitration”).</p><p>All parties agree that arbitrations are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event, act, omission, practice or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (“Administrative Arbitrator”). In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by us.</p><p>You and we agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of arbitrations, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings. This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.</p><p>You can opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration agreement that require the arbitration of Disputes within thirty (30) days of the date that you first agree to any version of this Agreement that requires arbitration of disputes with Script Derm or any of the Script Derm Parties, Medical Groups, Labs, or Pharmacies. To opt out, you must send your name, residence address, and email address together with a clear statement that you want to opt out of the requirement to arbitrate disputes with the applicable party to: Script Derm LLC 8 The Green #17369, Dover, DE 19901, ATTN: Arbitration Opt-Out. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us or any other Script Derm Parties.</p><p>Before you commence arbitration of a Dispute, you must provide us with a written Notice of Dispute that includes your name, residence address, username (if applicable) and email address associated with your User account (if applicable), a detailed description of the Dispute, and the relief you seek. Before we commence arbitration of a Dispute against you, we will provide a written Notice of Dispute to you with a detailed description of the Dispute and the relief we seek. Any Notice of Dispute you send to us should be mailed to Script Derm LLC, 8 The Green #17369, Dover, DE 19901 ATTN: Dispute Notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if we make any future material modification to any provisions of this Agreement that govern the arbitration or resolution of Disputes, such changes will not apply to any Dispute between you and us for which either party had previously provided a written Notice of Dispute to the other in accordance with this paragraph. Further, if we make any future material changes to the provisions of this Agreement that govern the arbitration or resolution of Disputes, you may reject such changes by sending a written notice of your rejection decision to us at Script Derm LLC, 8 The Green #17369, Dover, DE 19901. ATTN: Arbitration Opt-Out within 30 days of the effective date of such modifications. Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of these Terms and Conditions and did not validly opt out of arbitration. If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted the Terms and Conditions (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms and Conditions) remain in full force and effect. We will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of these Terms and Conditions.</p><p>Except as provided above, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</p><p><strong>Governing Law; Venue; Severability of Provisions</strong></p><p>This Service is controlled and operated by Script Derm from our offices within Delaware.
